By retaining only these components, one can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving most of the important information. The benefits of using PCA for feature selection include simplifying the model, reducing computational complexity, and potentially improving model generalization."

Even if certain dimensions have low variance individually, they may still contribute to the overall variance and be captured by the principal components.
